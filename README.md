## DataView Tree Example

The DataVie Tree example creates a tree UI based on a folder you select on your computer. The UI allows you to expand the contents of any folders listed. Double-clicking on a file or folder will open it.

You can right-click on a file or folder and rename it using the contextual menu. The file/folder will not actually be renamed but an answer dialog will appear showing you what the new name would be.

You will find the row templates used in the DataView in the `./app/templates/dataview tree templates` folder.
